# 📊 Mobile Game Performance Analysis: Revenue & Player Engagement Trends

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook analyzing revenue and daily active user (DAU) trends for a mobile game. The goal is to identify key insights, correlations, and trends that can inform business and game development strategies.

## 📂 Dataset Information

The analysis is based on data from a mobile game, including:

- **Revenue Data**: Daily revenue figures to assess financial performance trends.
- **Daily Active Users (DAU)**: Number of unique users accessing the game each day, providing insights into player engagement.

## 📊 Analysis Objectives

- Explore revenue and DAU trends over time.
- Identify seasonal patterns and anomalies in user engagement.
- Analyze the correlation between DAU and revenue.
- Provide actionable insights based on findings.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas**: Data cleaning and manipulation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Visualizing trends and patterns.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive data exploration.

## 📜 Notebook Structure

1. **Imports** – Load necessary Python libraries.
2. **Data Collection** – Import and inspect datasets.
3. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – Handle missing values, convert data types, and standardize formats.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualizing revenue, DAU, and their correlation.
5. **Statistical Analysis** – Identify meaningful patterns and relationships.
6. **Key Findings & Recommendations** – Summarize insights and provide actionable strategies.

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Further breakdown of revenue by source (ads, in-app purchases, etc.).
- A/B testing strategies to increase DAU and revenue.
- Expand analysis to include external factors (market trends, competitor analysis).
